        Approach</h4>\n<p>Built on top of the Jasmine test framework, using natural
        <em>expect(value).toBe(other)</em> assertions.</p>\n<h4>Mock by\u00a0Default</h4>\n<p>Automatically
        mocks CommonJS modules returned by <em>require()</em> as a result most existing
        code testable.</p>\n<h4>Short Feedback\u00a0Loop</h4>\n<p>DOM APIs are mocked.
        Tests run in parallel via a Node.js command-line utility.</p>\n<h4>Russel
        Werner, Lead Engineer at StackShare:</h4>\n<blockquote>Jest is fast and convenient

        E2E tests is flakiness\u200a\u2014\u200atests are usually not deterministic.</p>\n<p>There
        are two well-supported solutions on the market for mobile apps testing. Gray
        box end-to-end testing and automation library called <a href=\"https://github.com/wix/Detox\">Detox</a>,
        and open source, a cross-platform test automation tool for native, hybrid
        and mobile apps called\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/appium/appium\">Appium</a>.</p>\n<h3>Detox
        overview</h3>\n<p>The high speed of native mobile development requires us
        to adopt continuous integration workflows. It means our reliance on manual
        QA has to drop significantly. Detox tests your mobile app while it\u2019s
        running in a real device/simulator, interacting with it just like a real\u00a0user.</p>\n<p>Companies
        reportedly use Detox in their tech stacks, including Glorgo, Dropboy, and\u00a0Jumpn.</p>\n<h4>Core
        features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically Synchronized. Stops flakiness at the
        core by monitoring asynchronous operations in your\u00a0app</li>\n<li>Debuggable.
        Modern async-await API allows breakpoints in asynchronous tests to work as\u00a0expected</li>\n<li>Independent
        Test Runner. Use Mocha, AVA, or any other JavaScript test runner you\u00a0like</li>\n</ul>\n<a

        overview</h3>\n<p>Appium is an open-source test automation framework. You
        can use it with native, hybrid, and mobile web apps. It drives iOS and Android
        apps using the WebDriver protocol. Appium is sponsored by <a href=\"https://saucelabs.com/\">Sauce
        Labs</a> and a community of open source developers.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\"

        than 50 companies constantly use Appium in their tech stacks, including N26,
        Intuit, and PedidosYa.</p>\n<h4>Why developers like\u00a0Appium:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Open-source</li>\n<li>You
        don\u2019t have to recompile your app or modify it in any way, due to the
        use of standard automation APIs on all platforms</li>\n<li>You can write tests
        with your favorite dev tools using any WebDriver-compatible language such
        as Java, Objective-C, JavaScript (Node), PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Clojure, or
        Perl with the Selenium WebDriver API and language-specific client libraries</li>\n<li>You
        can use any testing framework</li>\n<li>Within the same script, you can switch
        seamlessly between native app automation and WebView automation, all using
        the WebDriver model that\u2019s already the standard for web automation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Kevin
        Roulleau, QA Engineer Freelance at\u00a0happn:</h4>\n<blockquote><em>I chose
        WebdriverIO and Appium to implement E2E tests solution on a native mobile
        app. WebdriverIO goes well beyond just implementing the Selenium / Appium
        protocol and allows us to run tests in parallel out of the box. Appium has
        the big advantage of supporting iOS and Android platforms, so the test codebase
        and tools are exactly the same, which greatly reduces the learning curve and
        implementation time.</em></blockquote>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Testing mobile
        applications is a big problem in modern software development. I analyzed the
        most popular testing methods in 2020. As a result, I didn\u2019t find a perfect
        solution that covers all\u00a0needs.</p>\n<p>Using Jest in pair with Enzyme
        will give you coverage of the individual components of the application. As
        a replacement for Enzyme, you can consider react-native-testing-library which
        has a smaller API, and enough for small projects hence takes up less memory
        and resources.</p>\n<p>For integration tests, you can use already discovered
        solutions, as well as new ones that are more convenient to use but for which
        you need to do additional configuration. Detox is built from the ground up
        to support React Native projects as well as pure native ones. Appium supports
        app automation across a variety of platforms, like iOS, Android, Windows,
        and\u00a0Mac.</p>\n<p><strong>Ilya Novohatskyi </strong>is a Software Engineer

        with <a href=\"https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/react-native.html\">Enzyme</a>
        to make unit testing more confident and more easygoing. You can do snapshot
        testing, test components, and assert functional staff.</p>\n<p>There is another
        option called <a href=\"https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library\">React
        Native Testing Library</a> is a lightweight React Native testing utilities
        helping you write better tests with less\u00a0effort.</p>\n<h3>Jest overview</h3>\n<p>More
        than 500 companies use Jest in their tech stacks, including Airbnb<strong>,
        </strong>Facebook<strong>, </strong>and Instagram.</p>\n<h4>Reasons why companies
        use\u00a0Jest:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Open-source</li>\n<li>Mock by default makes

        Approach</h4>\n<p>Built on top of the Jasmine test framework, using natural
        <em>expect(value).toBe(other)</em> assertions.</p>\n<h4>Mock by\u00a0Default</h4>\n<p>Automatically
        mocks CommonJS modules returned by <em>require()</em> as a result most existing
        code testable.</p>\n<h4>Short Feedback\u00a0Loop</h4>\n<p>DOM APIs are mocked.
        Tests run in parallel via a Node.js command-line utility.</p>\n<h4>Russel

        in under an\u00a0hour.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get to\u00a0it.</p>\n<h3>Step #1\u200a\u2014\u200aThe
        Power of Headlines</h3>\n<p>The headline has the ability to make or break
        a blog post. It impacts how (and if) it\u2019s found in search engines and
        social bookmarking sites, it influences whether people visit your blog in
        News Readers, it affects whether people leave a comment and is vital in whether
        people actually read what you have to\u00a0say.</p>\n<blockquote>Read more

        #2\u200a\u2014\u200aBuild an idea\u00a0bank</h3>\n<p>Use these questions to
        brainstorm, and add the answers to them. You can then use the headline formulas
        that I\u2019ll be giving you to craft a custom headline.</p>\n<p>Questions
        to use when considering your products/services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u2019s
        the\u00a0urgency?</li>\n<li>Why is your product relevant\u00a0now?</li>\n<li>Why
        is your product the #1 solution?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, audit your popular
        blog content. The best way to know what content will delight your audience
        is to pinpoint blog posts that have already hit the\u00a0mark.</p>\n<p>Get
        in tune with the desires and pain points of your target audience. It\u2019s
        to get into the heads and hearts of your audience. Here\u2019s where you can
        get that\u00a0insight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog comments</li>\n<li>Quora</li>\n<li>Facebook
        groups</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step #3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Importance of Being\u00a0Original</h3>\n<p>People
        are drawn to others who speak their minds, who have something unique to say
        and who say it in a creative and fresh way. Say what everyone else is saying
        in the same way that everyone else is saying it and you\u2019re almost guaranteed
        of being largely\u00a0ignored.</p>\n<p>Few extra principles to be more original:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Credibility</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aYour
        readers need to believe in their own ability to produce results. That\u2019s
        where providing easily consumable and actionable content will come into\u00a0play.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Urgency</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aYou
        need to help your readers get over their tendency to procrastinate. The way
        to do that is to emphasize the urgency. Why does the information in your blog
        post matter\u00a0today?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Authority</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200athe
        more authority you command, the more people will bet on you to deliver the
        transformation that they\u00a0seek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step #4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe
        Value of Scannable Content</h3>\n<p>Online readers tend to scan content. As
        a result, if you place visual cues in your posts that draw the eye to important
        points you\u2019ll find people stick with you longer into your\u00a0posts.</p>\n<blockquote>Read

        #5\u200a\u2014\u200aShortness is the\u00a0key</h3>\n<p>Use short sentences,
        short paragraphs, and short posts. Never write more than two pages on any
        subject. Over time, try to write less, not more. In general, shorten everything.</p>\n<p><em>Note:
        short does not mean that your writing can\u2019t be stylistic and intelligent.
        Short means simple and understandable.</em></p>\n<h3>Step #6\u200a\u2014\u200aShow,
        don\u2019t\u00a0tell</h3>\n<p>Show, don\u2019t tell is a technique used in
        various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through
        action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author\u2019s
        exposition, summarization, and description.</p>\n<p>It avoids adjectives describing
        the author\u2019s analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way
        that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions.</p>\n<h3>Step #7\u200a\u2014\u200aGreat\u00a0Visual</h3>\n<p>Another
        simple technique for providing an additional point of interest in your posts
        is to provide something visual.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t use images in every chapter,
        but add a few suitable pictures and screenshots in your article, it always
        increases reader attention. Images have the power to communicate in ways that
        words cannot\u200a\u2014\u200ause\u00a0them.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Even
        if you\u2019re a self-proclaimed terrible writer or hate the writing process,
        you still can create the persuasive content of an article without consuming
        days of your\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>What it takes is commitment and trust in the
        systems that have already been proven to generate\u00a0results.</p>\n<p>Good
        luck!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Ruslana</strong> is a Lead Generation Manager

        are moments when you\u2019re full of motivation, ideas come up with your mind
        and straight onto the page. But there are other moments when you take up hours
        of your time, before getting to that last sentence. You\u2019re almost about
        giving\u00a0up.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to write creating content. But not
        just any content. We\u2019re talking creative, suitable and interesting content
        that actually gets read. And that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll get in this\u00a0article.</p>\n<figure><img

        these specific formulas that you can plug-and-play to craft your blog posts
        in under an\u00a0hour.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get to\u00a0it.</p>\n<h3>Step #1\u200a\u2014\u200aThe
        Power of Headlines</h3>\n<p>The headline has the ability to make or break
        a blog post. It impacts how (and if) it\u2019s found in search engines and
        social bookmarking sites, it influences whether people visit your blog in
        News Readers, it affects whether people leave a comment and is vital in whether
        people actually read what you have to\u00a0say.</p>\n<blockquote>Read more

        #2\u200a\u2014\u200aBuild an idea\u00a0bank</h3>\n<p>Use these questions to
        brainstorm, and add the answers to them. You can then use the headline formulas
        that I\u2019ll be giving you to craft a custom headline.</p>\n<p>Questions
        to use when considering your products/services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u2019s
        the\u00a0urgency?</li>\n<li>Why is your product relevant\u00a0now?</li>\n<li>Why
        is your product the #1 solution?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, audit your popular
        blog content. The best way to know what content will delight your audience
        is to pinpoint blog posts that have already hit the\u00a0mark.</p>\n<p>Get
        in tune with the desires and pain points of your target audience. It\u2019s
        to get into the heads and hearts of your audience. Here\u2019s where you can
        get that\u00a0insight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog comments</li>\n<li>Quora</li>\n<li>Facebook
        groups</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step #3\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Importance of Being\u00a0Original</h3>\n<p>People
        are drawn to others who speak their minds, who have something unique to say
        and who say it in a creative and fresh way. Say what everyone else is saying
        in the same way that everyone else is saying it and you\u2019re almost guaranteed
        of being largely\u00a0ignored.</p>\n<p>Few extra principles to be more original:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Credibility</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aYour
        readers need to believe in their own ability to produce results. That\u2019s
        where providing easily consumable and actionable content will come into\u00a0play.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Urgency</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aYou
        need to help your readers get over their tendency to procrastinate. The way
        to do that is to emphasize the urgency. Why does the information in your blog
        post matter\u00a0today?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Authority</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200athe
        more authority you command, the more people will bet on you to deliver the
        transformation that they\u00a0seek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step #4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe
        Value of Scannable Content</h3>\n<p>Online readers tend to scan content. As
        a result, if you place visual cues in your posts that draw the eye to important
        points you\u2019ll find people stick with you longer into your\u00a0posts.</p>\n<blockquote>Read

        #5\u200a\u2014\u200aShortness is the\u00a0key</h3>\n<p>Use short sentences,
        short paragraphs, and short posts. Never write more than two pages on any
        subject. Over time, try to write less, not more. In general, shorten everything.</p>\n<p><em>Note:
        short does not mean that your writing can\u2019t be stylistic and intelligent.
        Short means simple and understandable.</em></p>\n<h3>Step #6\u200a\u2014\u200aShow,
        don\u2019t\u00a0tell</h3>\n<p>Show, don\u2019t tell is a technique used in
        various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through
        action, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author\u2019s
        exposition, summarization, and description.</p>\n<p>It avoids adjectives describing
        the author\u2019s analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way
        that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions.</p>\n<h3>Step #7\u200a\u2014\u200aGreat\u00a0Visual</h3>\n<p>Another
        simple technique for providing an additional point of interest in your posts
        is to provide something visual.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t use images in every chapter,
        but add a few suitable pictures and screenshots in your article, it always
        increases reader attention. Images have the power to communicate in ways that
        words cannot\u200a\u2014\u200ause\u00a0them.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Even
        if you\u2019re a self-proclaimed terrible writer or hate the writing process,
        you still can create the persuasive content of an article without consuming
        days of your\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>What it takes is commitment and trust in the
        systems that have already been proven to generate\u00a0results.</p>\n<p>Good
        luck!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Ruslana</strong> is a Lead Generation Manager

        conduct a little experiment and see if it is possible to integrate the <em>Sidekiq.cr</em>
        into the Rails application without spending a lot of effort and keeping the
        code cleanliness.</p>\n<h3>Ruby Part</h3>\n<p>In the <em>Rails</em> application,
        it\u2019s better to isolate the logic by creating the job in a separate service
        before getting it to work with the <em>Crystal</em> implementation.</p>\n<p>For
        using the <em>Crystal</em> worker implementation, its class name and the <em>Sidekiq</em>
        queue name should be defined as the arguments. This is the way our service
        will look\u00a0like:</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all for the Rails application!!!</p>\n<h3>Crystal
        Part</h3>\n<p>In order to support the worker implementation on <em>Crystal</em>,
        this part should have <em>Sidekig.cr. </em>As it is pointed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq.cr/wiki/Getting-Started#create-some-jobs-using-the-client-api\">documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Crystal
        can push jobs for a Ruby process to consume, and vice versa. <br>The Crystal
        Web UI can monitor Ruby processes, and vice\u00a0versa.</blockquote>\n<p>The
        next requisition is the ability to work with a database that is the same for
        the <em>Rails</em> and the <em>Crystal</em> parts. There are several frameworks
        based on <em>Crystal</em>, which allow such a database connection. To make
        a choice, we formed the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it should be
        easy to customize and\u00a0maintain</li>\n<li>it should allow finding the
        record in a database and updating\u00a0it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After some research,
        we choose <a href=\"https://github.com/amberframework/granite\"><em>Granite</em></a><em>.
        </em>Its pros\u00a0are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>easy support</li>\n<li>ability to define
        only attributes, which are going to be\u00a0used</li>\n<li>supporting the
        Rails-like helpers to operate with the\u00a0records</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The model
        in the <em>Crystal</em> application will look\u00a0like:</p>\n<p>Example of
        environment configuration in the s<em>hard.yml</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/amberframework/granite/blob/master/docs/readme.md#register-a-connection\">Configure
        the connection</a> to a database:</p>\n<p>max_pool_size and initial_pool_size\u200a\u2014\u200aare
        configuration parameters for the <a href=\"https://crystal-lang.org/reference/database/connection_pool.html\">connection
        pool</a>.</p>\n<p>The next step\u200a\u2014\u200a<em>Sidekiq::CLI</em> configuration
        and preload of the connection with a database:</p>\n<p>WORKER_CR_CONCURRENCY-
        is the environment variable that defines the maximum size for a connection
        pool.</p>\n<h3>Sidekiq worker in the Crystal\u00a0Part</h3>\n<p>This worker
        will be responsible for fetching the record from the database and running

        the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n","content":"\n<blockquote>Where
        is it better to start the Sidekiq jobs transition from Ruby to Crystal in
        order to optimize the resources usage on the server and, at the same time,
        not to struggle with the duplication?</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\"
        src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/706/1*Bfh0Xi52cBZdfXtMoWBmHQ.png\"></figure><p>Let\u2019s
        conduct a little experiment and see if it is possible to integrate the <em>Sidekiq.cr</em>
        into the Rails application without spending a lot of effort and keeping the
        code cleanliness.</p>\n<h3>Ruby Part</h3>\n<p>In the <em>Rails</em> application,
        it\u2019s better to isolate the logic by creating the job in a separate service
        before getting it to work with the <em>Crystal</em> implementation.</p>\n<p>For
        using the <em>Crystal</em> worker implementation, its class name and the <em>Sidekiq</em>
        queue name should be defined as the arguments. This is the way our service
        will look\u00a0like:</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all for the Rails application!!!</p>\n<h3>Crystal
        Part</h3>\n<p>In order to support the worker implementation on <em>Crystal</em>,
        this part should have <em>Sidekig.cr. </em>As it is pointed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq.cr/wiki/Getting-Started#create-some-jobs-using-the-client-api\">documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Crystal
        can push jobs for a Ruby process to consume, and vice versa. <br>The Crystal
        Web UI can monitor Ruby processes, and vice\u00a0versa.</blockquote>\n<p>The
        next requisition is the ability to work with a database that is the same for
        the <em>Rails</em> and the <em>Crystal</em> parts. There are several frameworks
        based on <em>Crystal</em>, which allow such a database connection. To make
        a choice, we formed the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it should be
        easy to customize and\u00a0maintain</li>\n<li>it should allow finding the
        record in a database and updating\u00a0it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After some research,
        we choose <a href=\"https://github.com/amberframework/granite\"><em>Granite</em></a><em>.
        </em>Its pros\u00a0are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>easy support</li>\n<li>ability to define
        only attributes, which are going to be\u00a0used</li>\n<li>supporting the
        Rails-like helpers to operate with the\u00a0records</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The model
        in the <em>Crystal</em> application will look\u00a0like:</p>\n<p>Example of
        environment configuration in the s<em>hard.yml</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/amberframework/granite/blob/master/docs/readme.md#register-a-connection\">Configure
        the connection</a> to a database:</p>\n<p>max_pool_size and initial_pool_size\u200a\u2014\u200aare
        configuration parameters for the <a href=\"https://crystal-lang.org/reference/database/connection_pool.html\">connection
        pool</a>.</p>\n<p>The next step\u200a\u2014\u200a<em>Sidekiq::CLI</em> configuration
        and preload of the connection with a database:</p>\n<p>WORKER_CR_CONCURRENCY-
        is the environment variable that defines the maximum size for a connection
        pool.</p>\n<h3>Sidekiq worker in the Crystal\u00a0Part</h3>\n<p>This worker
        will be responsible for fetching the record from the database and running
        some services:</p>\n<p>The worker\u2019s name should match WORKER_NAME defined
        in the <em>Rails</em>\u00a0service:</p>\n<pre>WORKER_NAME = ''Broolik::Worker::URLChecker''</pre>\n<p>Specify
        the queue for the job the same as in the <em>Rails</em> <em>ScheduleUrlCheckService</em>:</p>\n<pre>''queue''
        =&gt; ''worker.cr''</pre>\n<h3>Make friends Crystal and\u00a0Ruby</h3>\n<p>Thus,

        This is what pulls the reader into your blog entry. Make it specific, brief,

        The hook grabs your attention and then leads the reader into the transition.

        blog\u00a0entry.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><em>Thesis:</em></strong> The last element
        of an introduction is the thesis. It summarizes the topic and strengthens
        the reason why the reader should continue with your blog post idea. If you
        do a great job at the transition stage, the thesis will likely fall into place
        and make a great blog\u00a0post.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/605/0*EeGx6dBo1kGvLYmY\"></figure><p>Anyway,

        #1: Use numbers &amp; data in your\u00a0headline</strong></h4>\n<p>Using numbers
        and data into your headline is an effective way to make your headlines more
        fascinating to readers. Several research studies have shown that headlines
        with numbers tend to generate 73% more social shares and engagement.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step
        #2: Take a unique rationale into\u00a0account</strong></h4>\n<p>Use unique
        rationales to write great headlines. The word \u201crationale\u201d simply
        means \u201can underlying reason on why something should be\u00a0done.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em>Some
        of the rationales that you can include in your headlines are: </em></strong>Tips,
        Reasons, Lessons, Tricks, Ideas, Ways, Principles, Facts, Secrets, Strategies</p>\n<figure><img
        alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*K7m9YMwsMGd51RHC\"></figure><h4><strong>Step
        #3: Call for attention</strong></h4>\n<p>\u2018Attention\u2019 simply means
        mental focus and serious concentration on a given task. How to get it? Here
        are 4 rules to\u00a0follow:</p>\n<ul><li>Make the headline\u00a0<strong>unique</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u2018Unique\u2019
        means being one of a kind. In other words, your headline has to be different
        from others. But, how do you test for uniqueness?</p>\n<p><em>Simple tip:</em>
        plug it into Google and enclose the headline in double quotation marks.</p>\n<ul><li>Be
        <strong>ultra-specific</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Your prospects have questions
        and they want answers. If you can provide them with an ultra-specific headline
        and the answer to their questions, you will convert them into loyal readers
        and customers. The more precise you are, the more authority you\u2019ll gain
        in your industry.</p>\n<ul><li>It should convey a sense of\u00a0<strong>urgency</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Urgency-based
        headlines will always grab attention because it makes the reader anticipate
        what comes next. They don\u2019t want to miss out on what\u2019s on the other
        side of the headline, once it\u2019s\u00a0clicked.</p>\n<ul><li>Your headline
        has to be\u00a0<strong>useful</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Useful can mean several
        things\u200a\u2014\u200apractical, helpful, valuable, informative, worthwhile,
        beneficial, advantageous and so on. The bottom line is to help the readers
        experience hope, knowing that their problem can still be\u00a0solved.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step
        #4: Use headline\u00a0formulas</strong></h4>\n<p>What makes a headline good
        is it\u2019s a formula. Every content marketer has one or more formulas for
        writing headlines. When using formulas, make sure to include power words that
        will get people to buy your product or join your waiting\u00a0list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>\u2018Little
        known ways\u2019 </em>formula: How many times have you used this formula to
        write a catchy headline? Discovered that the <em>\u2018little known ways [put
        your solution here]\u2019</em> formula is typically a social\u00a0magnet.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\u2018Get
        rid of [problem] once and for all\u2019 </em>formula: Who wouldn\u2019t want
        to permanently get rid of an annoying problem that they\u2019re faced with
        on a daily basis? When you write your headlines with this strategy in mind,
        you\u2019ll captivate your audience from start to finish, because they want
        to know the secret,\u00a0too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://jtway.co/@rbr.jt\"><strong><em>Ruslana</em></strong></a>

        #1: Use numbers &amp; data in your\u00a0headline</strong></h4>\n<p>Using numbers
        and data into your headline is an effective way to make your headlines more
        fascinating to readers. Several research studies have shown that headlines
        with numbers tend to generate 73% more social shares and engagement.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step
        #2: Take a unique rationale into\u00a0account</strong></h4>\n<p>Use unique
        rationales to write great headlines. The word \u201crationale\u201d simply
        means \u201can underlying reason on why something should be\u00a0done.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong><em>Some
        of the rationales that you can include in your headlines are: </em></strong>Tips,
        Reasons, Lessons, Tricks, Ideas, Ways, Principles, Facts, Secrets, Strategies</p>\n<figure><img

        #3: Call for attention</strong></h4>\n<p>\u2018Attention\u2019 simply means
        mental focus and serious concentration on a given task. How to get it? Here
        are 4 rules to\u00a0follow:</p>\n<ul><li>Make the headline\u00a0<strong>unique</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u2018Unique\u2019
        means being one of a kind. In other words, your headline has to be different
        from others. But, how do you test for uniqueness?</p>\n<p><em>Simple tip:</em>
        plug it into Google and enclose the headline in double quotation marks.</p>\n<ul><li>Be
        <strong>ultra-specific</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Your prospects have questions
        and they want answers. If you can provide them with an ultra-specific headline
        and the answer to their questions, you will convert them into loyal readers
        and customers. The more precise you are, the more authority you\u2019ll gain
        in your industry.</p>\n<ul><li>It should convey a sense of\u00a0<strong>urgency</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Urgency-based
        headlines will always grab attention because it makes the reader anticipate
        what comes next. They don\u2019t want to miss out on what\u2019s on the other
        side of the headline, once it\u2019s\u00a0clicked.</p>\n<ul><li>Your headline
        has to be\u00a0<strong>useful</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>Useful can mean several
        things\u200a\u2014\u200apractical, helpful, valuable, informative, worthwhile,
        beneficial, advantageous and so on. The bottom line is to help the readers
        experience hope, knowing that their problem can still be\u00a0solved.</p>\n<h4><strong>Step
        #4: Use headline\u00a0formulas</strong></h4>\n<p>What makes a headline good
        is it\u2019s a formula. Every content marketer has one or more formulas for
        writing headlines. When using formulas, make sure to include power words that
        will get people to buy your product or join your waiting\u00a0list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>\u2018Little
        known ways\u2019 </em>formula: How many times have you used this formula to
        write a catchy headline? Discovered that the <em>\u2018little known ways [put
        your solution here]\u2019</em> formula is typically a social\u00a0magnet.</li>\n<li>\n<em>\u2018Get
        rid of [problem] once and for all\u2019 </em>formula: Who wouldn\u2019t want
        to permanently get rid of an annoying problem that they\u2019re faced with
        on a daily basis? When you write your headlines with this strategy in mind,
        you\u2019ll captivate your audience from start to finish, because they want
        to know the secret,\u00a0too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://jtway.co/@rbr.jt\"><strong><em>Ruslana</em></strong></a>

        tests in four\u00a0phases</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html\">Four-Phase
        Test</a> is a testing pattern, applicable to all programming languages and
        unit tests (not so much integration tests).</p>\n<p>There are four distinct
        phases of the test. They are executed sequentially.</p>\n<pre>test do<br>  setup<br>  exercise<br>  verify<br>  teardown<br>end</pre>\n<h4>setup</h4>\n<p>During
        setup, setup initial\u00a0state.</p>\n<pre>user = User.new(password: ''password'')</pre>\n<h4>exercise</h4>\n<p>At
        this stage, run/execute a tested scenario.</p>\n<pre>user.save</pre>\n<h4>verify</h4>\n<p>Here,
        the result of the exercise is verified against the developer\u2019s expectations.</p>\n<pre>user.encrypted_password.should_not
        be_nil</pre>\n<h4>teardown</h4>\n<p>During the teardown, the system under
        test is reset to its pre-setup state.</p>\n<h3>Maintain a single level of
        abstraction</h3>\n<p>Each acceptance test tells a story: a logical progression
        through a task within an application. As developers, it\u2019s our responsibility
        to tell each story in a concise manner and to keep the reader (either other
        developers or our future selves) engaged, aware of what is happening, and
        understanding the purpose of the\u00a0story.</p>\n<p>At the heart of understanding
        the story being told is a consistent, single level of abstraction; that is,
        each piece of behavior is roughly similar in terms of functionality extracted
        and its overall\u00a0purpose.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s first focus on an example
        of how <em>not</em> to write an acceptance test by writing a test at multiple
        levels of abstraction:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/af7d82617bbdbbb49c9c09bda7f0565f/href\">https://medium.com/media/af7d82617bbdbbb49c9c09bda7f0565f/href</a><p>Let\u2019s
        now look at a scenario written at a single level of abstraction:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3ec9347642e24c07c57297306beabc1e/href\">https://medium.com/media/3ec9347642e24c07c57297306beabc1e/href</a><p>This
        spec follows the <a href=\"http://c2.com/ppr/wiki/WikiPagesAboutRefactoring/ComposedMethod.html\">Composed
        Method pattern</a>, discussed in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X\">Smalltalk
        Best Practice Patterns</a>, wherein each piece of functionality is extracted
        to well-named methods. Each method should be written at a single level of
        abstraction.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a single level of abstraction is a tool in
        every developer\u2019s arsenal to help achieve clear, understandable tests.
        By extracting behavior to well-named methods, the developer can better tell
        the story of each scenario by describing behaviors consistently and at a high
        enough level that others will understand the goal and outcomes of the\u00a0test.</p>\n<h3>Be
        explicit about\u00a0naming</h3>\n<p>Some main rules related to\u00a0naming:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use
        regular text, when describing features and everything else, i.e. user change
        to predefined date\u00a0range</li>\n<li>Use actual class names, when describing
        classes or test name, i.e. UserSelectDimensionMetricTest</li>\n<li>Use unique
        data-attribute for testing, i.e. test-id=\"dimension-list\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Guidelines
        about organization</h3>\n<p>There are three major blocks dedicated to documenting
        our\u00a0tests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>describe helps us to define our subject\u200a\u2014\u200ausually
        top-level describe is either a feature name or a class name, while lower-level
        describe defining methods, constants, etc.</li>\n<li>context should clearly
        describe\u2026 context (or environment) in which our assertions will be verified.
        Each context should describe only one aspect of the environment and we should
        refrain from including contexts in expectations.</li>\n<li>And it.The good
        practice is to use present simple tense to describe expectations and keep
        those expectations concise, precise and unambiguous.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Set

        for writing readable system tests in\u00a0Rails</h3>\n<blockquote>Want to
        make system tests easy to main tain? We have selected some best practice tips
        to help achieve\u00a0this.</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6-i2S6NgYxpEyJHS.jpg\"></figure><h3>Organize
        tests in four\u00a0phases</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html\">Four-Phase
        Test</a> is a testing pattern, applicable to all programming languages and
        unit tests (not so much integration tests).</p>\n<p>There are four distinct
        phases of the test. They are executed sequentially.</p>\n<pre>test do<br>  setup<br>  exercise<br>  verify<br>  teardown<br>end</pre>\n<h4>setup</h4>\n<p>During
        setup, setup initial\u00a0state.</p>\n<pre>user = User.new(password: ''password'')</pre>\n<h4>exercise</h4>\n<p>At
        this stage, run/execute a tested scenario.</p>\n<pre>user.save</pre>\n<h4>verify</h4>\n<p>Here,
        the result of the exercise is verified against the developer\u2019s expectations.</p>\n<pre>user.encrypted_password.should_not
        be_nil</pre>\n<h4>teardown</h4>\n<p>During the teardown, the system under
        test is reset to its pre-setup state.</p>\n<h3>Maintain a single level of
        abstraction</h3>\n<p>Each acceptance test tells a story: a logical progression
        through a task within an application. As developers, it\u2019s our responsibility
        to tell each story in a concise manner and to keep the reader (either other
        developers or our future selves) engaged, aware of what is happening, and
        understanding the purpose of the\u00a0story.</p>\n<p>At the heart of understanding
        the story being told is a consistent, single level of abstraction; that is,
        each piece of behavior is roughly similar in terms of functionality extracted
        and its overall\u00a0purpose.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s first focus on an example
        of how <em>not</em> to write an acceptance test by writing a test at multiple
        levels of abstraction:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/af7d82617bbdbbb49c9c09bda7f0565f/href\">https://medium.com/media/af7d82617bbdbbb49c9c09bda7f0565f/href</a><p>Let\u2019s
        now look at a scenario written at a single level of abstraction:</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/media/3ec9347642e24c07c57297306beabc1e/href\">https://medium.com/media/3ec9347642e24c07c57297306beabc1e/href</a><p>This
        spec follows the <a href=\"http://c2.com/ppr/wiki/WikiPagesAboutRefactoring/ComposedMethod.html\">Composed
        Method pattern</a>, discussed in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X\">Smalltalk
        Best Practice Patterns</a>, wherein each piece of functionality is extracted
        to well-named methods. Each method should be written at a single level of
        abstraction.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a single level of abstraction is a tool in
        every developer\u2019s arsenal to help achieve clear, understandable tests.
        By extracting behavior to well-named methods, the developer can better tell
        the story of each scenario by describing behaviors consistently and at a high
        enough level that others will understand the goal and outcomes of the\u00a0test.</p>\n<h3>Be
        explicit about\u00a0naming</h3>\n<p>Some main rules related to\u00a0naming:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use
        regular text, when describing features and everything else, i.e. user change
        to predefined date\u00a0range</li>\n<li>Use actual class names, when describing
        classes or test name, i.e. UserSelectDimensionMetricTest</li>\n<li>Use unique
        data-attribute for testing, i.e. test-id=\"dimension-list\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Guidelines
        about organization</h3>\n<p>There are three major blocks dedicated to documenting
        our\u00a0tests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>describe helps us to define our subject\u200a\u2014\u200ausually
        top-level describe is either a feature name or a class name, while lower-level
        describe defining methods, constants, etc.</li>\n<li>context should clearly
        describe\u2026 context (or environment) in which our assertions will be verified.
        Each context should describe only one aspect of the environment and we should
        refrain from including contexts in expectations.</li>\n<li>And it.The good
        practice is to use present simple tense to describe expectations and keep
        those expectations concise, precise and unambiguous.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Set
        up only relevant information</h3>\n<p>To facilitate the process between the
        test setup and the assertions easier, it may be useful to be as clear as possible
        about\u00a0data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use more or less real values in the context,
        i.e. assigning a user name of user_1 isn\u2019t a good\u00a0idea.</li>\n<li>Irrelevant
        information is another cause of obscure tests. expect(page.title).to eq(dimensions[:title]
        will be clearer expect(page.title).to eq(''Date'').</li>\n<li>Limit the use
        of local variables, and just use explicit (yes, duplicated) values directly.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t
        use fixtures. Fixtures, usually stored in separate files, hide important context
        of spec, necessary to understand it to the fullest\u00a0extent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Follow
